/**
 * Cloudinary server-signed upload helper.
 *
 * The browser POSTs to Cloudinary directly using a signature we generate here.
 * The API secret never leaves the server. Flow:
 *
 *   1. Browser calls GET /api/upload/sign
 *   2. We return { cloudName, apiKey, timestamp, signature, folder, ... }
 *   3. Browser POSTs the file to https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/<cloud>/<resource>/upload
 *      with these fields + `file` (data URI or blob).
 *   4. Cloudinary returns { secure_url, public_id, width, height, ... }.
 *   5. Browser POSTs that metadata to the relevant model endpoint
 *      (e.g. /api/auth/profile for avatar, /api/community for post attachments).
 *
 * Signature: SHA1 of (sorted-key=value pairs joined by '&') + API secret.
 * Per Cloudinary docs: https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#generating_authentication_signatures
