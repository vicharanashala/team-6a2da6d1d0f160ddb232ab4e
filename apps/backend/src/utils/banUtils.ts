/**
 * banUtils — Golden Ticket "Ban User + Reject" enforcement helpers.
 *
 * v1.66 — When an admin rejects a Golden ticket and chooses the
 * "Ban User + Reject" action, the user's `goldenBannedUntil` is set
 * to `now + 72h`. While set, the user CAN still:
 *   - log in
 *   - browse the platform
 *   - view pages, FAQs, community posts
 *
 * But they CANNOT:
 *   - raise support tickets (POST /support/requests)
 *   - raise Golden tickets (admin conversion, but user-side tickets)
 *   - post community questions/answers/comments
 *   - upload knowledge documents
 *
 * The auth middleware (authShared.ts) does NOT check `goldenBannedUntil`
 * — that field is intentionally weaker than `isBanned` / `suspendedUntil`
 * (both of which DO trigger a 403 at the auth layer). Content-creation
 * endpoints call `assertCanCreateContent(user, res)` as the first line
 * of their handler. This keeps "browse but not create" working.
 *
 * Auto-unban is implicit: the check is `goldenBannedUntil > now`, not
 * a derived `isGoldenBanned: true` flag. The `clearExpiredGoldenBans()`
 * function (run by the escalation scheduler) NULLs out the field once
 * it has passed, keeping the DB clean.

 * ban, an ADDITIONAL `1.25 * spCost` is debited as a penalty. The
