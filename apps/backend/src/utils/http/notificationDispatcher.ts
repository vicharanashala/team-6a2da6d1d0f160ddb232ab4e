// Note: a previous version of this file attempted to emit a real-time Socket.io
// event after persisting a notification. Socket.io is not installed and no
// server is initialized anywhere, so the emit was a no-op. If real-time
// notifications are ever needed, install `socket.io`, create a Server in
// server.ts after `app.listen`, and reintroduce the emit here. For now the
// notification is persisted to MongoDB only — clients poll
// /api/notifications/tea (30s) and /api/notifications to read state.
